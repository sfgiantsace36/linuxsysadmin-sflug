The San Francisco Linux Users Group's Linux Systems Administration Study Group

==========================================================
The SF-LUG Linux System Administration Study Group
==========================================================

About the group

The Linux Systems Administration Study Group (LSG) has been created in direct relation to the SF-LUG group and other related Linux events.
*   We share and practice skills for Linux System Administration and hack on any and all things Linux/FOSS.
*   We emphasize that everyone is welcome
*   We encourage new people of all user levels to join in.
*   We also encourage users/hackers/developers of any, and all, operating systems who are interested in Linux. 

When

When is this study group? 
Now on Thursdays from 15:00 to 17:00


Meeting location
*    We are now meeting at a SECRET LOCATION. 
*    Email maestro415@gmail.com for the coordinates and directions.
*    For weekly announcements, check out the Noisebridge-Discuss list -->https://www.noisebridge.net/mailman/listinfo/noisebridge-discuss

Our Current Focus

*    We'll be setting up various networking equipment (server,switch, router, gateway, etc.) in two different rooms at the new location (as time provides) as well as starting other study topics.
*    We'll be moving a box with existing server and routing software from one room to another room and connecting it to their network and securing it.
*    This will be done as it would be in an occupational scenario giving two rooms internet via eth_ and wlan_ (i.e., establishing full connectivity via hardwire and wireless.)

Past Bash Shell Scripting for Linux Systems Administrators

In early 2012 the study group focused on shell scripting in Bash. The class was very small, but was growing for a long while. 
The shell scripters were meeting and working through their code on a line by line basis. This article on redirection -->http://www.linuxintheshell.org/2012/02/16/entry-000-redirection/ is a great read as a followup to the past 2012-02-21 meeting. One of the shell scripters, Grant Bowman, put out this good meta-guide -->http://www.grantbow.com/command_line.html for learning the Command Line and for creating more advanced shell scripting in Bash. There are also the most recent The Linux Command Line book listed above and the Advanced Bash-Scripting Guide v6.6.x -->http://bash.deta.in/ available in various downloadable formats.
